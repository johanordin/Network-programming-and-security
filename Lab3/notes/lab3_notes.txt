Hi,

if you want to run the example SecureAdditionServer/Client from Ch12 on two machines (the server on one machine and the client on a different on)

then the onlt thing you need to do is to open two command windows. In one you run first the server, and in the second one you run:

java SecureAdditionClient 130.22.44.56

that is you pass as argument the IP address of the server. In my case the server is running on 130.22.44.56

The server IP address is taken care by (***)

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        try {
            InetAddress host = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
           
            if ( args.length > 0 ) {
                host = InetAddress.getByName( args[0] );     (***)
            }
            SecureAdditionClient addClient = new SecureAdditionClient( host );
            addClient.run();
        }
        catch ( UnknownHostException uhx ) {
            System.out.println( uhx );
            uhx.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
